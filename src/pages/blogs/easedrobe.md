  <p>
    This isn't just a project breakdown â€” it's a story. From scribbling the idea during an outfit crisis to hacking through APIs, here's a casual timeline of how I built Easedrobe â€” my smart wardrobe assistant powered by AI and computer vision.

  <!-- ðŸ§  Idea Section -->
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ§  The Spark</h2>
    <p>
      It started when I realized I kept re-wearing the same 5 outfits â€” not because I don't have clothes, but because I didn't remember what I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      That got me thinking... What if I could *digitize* my wardrobe and get outfit suggestions like Spotify gives music recs?
    </p>
    <p>
      That thought snowballed into the first sketch of **Easedrobe**.

      <li>Make it easy to log and browse my wardrobe visually</li>
      <li>Suggest outfits based on weather, event, or color match</li>
      <li>Use AI to make this smart â€” not just a dumb image gallery</li>
    </ul>

            Drew out how I wanted the wardrobe page to look and how adding new clothes should work. Started playing with Tailwind UI cards.

            Integrated a basic CV model to detect shirts, pants, etc. Used TensorFlow.js and tested a few pre-trained classifiers.

  <!-- ðŸ’­ Closing Note -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ’­ Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Building Easedrobe has been fun, frustrating, and full of learning. I'm still experimenting with new ideas, but it already feels like one of my most "me" projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're building something similar â€” or if you just forget what's in your closet too â€” hit me up, let's swap ideas.
